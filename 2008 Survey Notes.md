ASICs (Application Specific Integrated Circuits) are often extremely expensive and take a long time to fabricate, so FPGAs are a great alternative to ASICs when prototyping / testing new designs. 

FPGA requires approximately 20 to 35 times more area than a standard cell ASIC, has a speed performance roughly 3 to 4 times slower than an ASIC and consumes roughly 10 times as much dynamic power (**Note that this is data collected from 2008**)


## 1.1: Overview
FPGAs consist of an array of programmable logic blocks of potentially different types, including general logic, memory and multiplier blocks, surrounded by a programmable routing fabric that allows blocks to be programmably interconnected. The array is surrounded by programmable input/output blocks, labeled I/O in the figure, that connect the chip to the outside world.
